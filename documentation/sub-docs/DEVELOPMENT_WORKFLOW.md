# DefiFundr Development Workflow

## Purpose
This workflow establishes a clear and efficient process for **code development** and **documentation** in the DefiFundr project. It ensures consistency, quality, and collaboration across all aspects of the project.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

1. **Project Lead**:
   - Oversees the entire development process.
   - Approves pull requests (PRs) for both code and documentation.
   - Ensures alignment with project goals.

2. **Developers**:
   - Write and maintain code for their respective modules.
   - Write technical documentation for their code.
   - Update documentation when features or functionality change.

3. **Technical Writers**:
   - Assist in creating user-friendly guides and tutorials.
   - Ensure documentation is accessible to non-technical users.

4. **Quality Assurance (QA)**:
   - Test code changes to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.
   - Verify that documentation matches the implemented features.

5. **Contributors**:
   - Follow the development workflow when submitting changes.
   - Collaborate with the team to improve code and documentation.

---

## Workflow Steps

### 1. **Planning**
   - Identify the task (e.g., new feature, bug fix, documentation update).
   - Create an issue in the GitHub repository with a clear description and acceptance criteria.
   - Assign the issue to the appropriate team member.

### 2. **Branching**
   - Create a new branch from the `develop` branch using the following naming conventions:
     - For features: `feature/[short-description]`
     - For bug fixes: `fix/[short-description]`
     - For documentation: `docs/[short-description]`
   - Example: `feature/add-payroll-module`, `fix/login-bug`, `docs/update-readme`.

### 3. **Development**
   - Write code or documentation following the project’s **coding standards** and **writing guidelines**.
   - Include unit tests for code changes.
   - For documentation, include diagrams, screenshots, or code snippets where necessary.

### 4. **Testing**
   - Run unit tests and integration tests locally.
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR.
   - For documentation, verify accuracy, clarity, and completeness.

### 5. **Pull Request (PR)**
   - Submit a PR to the `develop` branch.
   - Include a detailed description of the changes.
   - Tag relevant team members for review (e.g., Project Lead, QA, Documentation Lead).

### 6. **Review**
   - Reviewers provide feedback on the PR.
   - Address feedback and make necessary revisions.
   - Ensure code and documentation are aligned.

### 7. **Approval**
   - Once the PR is approved, the **Project Lead** merges it into the `develop` branch.
   - Ensure the PR is linked to the original issue.

### 8. **Testing (Post-Merge)**
   - Run automated tests (e.g., CI/CD pipelines) to ensure no regressions.
   - Perform manual testing if necessary.

### 9. **Deployment**
   - Merge `develop` into `main` for production releases.
   - Deploy the changes to the appropriate environment (e.g., staging, production).

### 10. **Maintenance**
   - Monitor the deployed changes for issues.
   - Update documentation to reflect any changes or new features.
   - Archive outdated code and documentation.

## Tools and Resources

### Code Development
1. **Version Control**:
   - Use **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
2. **Coding Standards**:
   - Follow the project’s coding style guide (e.g., linting rules, naming conventions).
3. **Testing**:
   - Use testing frameworks (e.g., Jest for JavaScript, pytest for Python).
   - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
4. **Code Reviews**:
   - Use GitHub’s PR review tools for collaborative feedback.

### Documentation
1. **Version Control**:
   - Store documentation in the `docs` folder of the repository.
2. **Templates**:
   - Provide templates for common documentation types (e.g., README, API docs, user guides).
3. **Writing Guidelines**:
   - Maintain a style guide for consistent tone, formatting, and terminology.
4. **Automation**:
   - Use tools like **GitHub Actions** to automate documentation checks (e.g., spelling, formatting).
   - Integrate tools like **Swagger** for API documentation generation.

## Branching and PR Guidelines

### Branch Naming
Use the following format for branches:
- Features: `feature/[short-description]`
- Bug Fixes: `fix/[short-description]`
- Documentation: `docs/[short-description]`

Examples:
- `feature/add-invoice-module`
- `fix/resolve-login-error`
- `docs/update-api-docs`

### Pull Requests
- Target the `develop` branch for PRs.
- Include a detailed description of the changes.
- Tag relevant reviewers (e.g., Project Lead, QA, Documentation Lead).

## Review Checklist

### Code Reviews
1. **Functionality**:
   - Does the code work as intended?
2. **Quality**:
   - Is the code clean, readable, and maintainable?
3. **Testing**:
   - Are there sufficient unit and integration tests?
4. **Documentation**:
   - Is the code well-documented (e.g., comments, README updates)?
